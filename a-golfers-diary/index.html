love of the game!</p><p>A been
playing golf for a few years now but mostly casual. I lived in Canada for over
a decade and their golf is more like a public sport. Something fun to do with
friends.</p><p>So I
played a few rounds, but they kind of looked like this.</p><p>Drive to
the golf course preferably sober.</p><p>Pay for the round and walk to the bar to buy a drink and a 6 pack for the walk down the first few holes.</p><p>No practice
needed before walking to hole one. Just a beer did the trick.</p><p>Do a few
practice swings and tee up.</p><p>With a
little bit of luck did my first ball go past the woman’s red tee box. And off we went.</p><p>The fun
think about playing with friends in Canada is that most people have hit a ball
before and almost everyone has a set of golf clubs in the garage. The way of
playing is relaxed. No hurry and not to serious.</p><p>Have
some fun, drink some beers or maybe even a cocktail when the boozecart comes
driving by.</p><p>You’re
playing mates always give you some tips to play better golf, but no one really
had some training from PGA trainers before. They all watched some YouTube
channels to learn to hit better. But it all was just mostly to have fun and
something to do in the summer.</p><p>The only
tip I remember till this day was to clear my head when taking a swing. The guy
told me to think of boobs when starting my swing. That tip I will never forget.
Not that I actually use this tip but I always cracks me up when I think about
it.</p><p>But the
time we drove 18 holes we all were pretty liquored up and playing golf was just
to legally drink a bunch of booze and have a great time with friends.</p><p>I had some amazing days like this with my
buddies.</p><p>Just to
name a couple round I will never forget.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d7f47997-d5ed-4ecd-be4d-e03e2babfb40.jpg" alt="" title="" /><p>We did a tournament from my local bar ones. This was a yearly thing the bar organized every year.</p><p>You had
to make a team of 4 and all dress kind of the same. We all went in bleu Hawaiian
shirts with dress pants. It was hilarious and just ones drunken good time. Can’t
remember how the round of golf went but still remember the fun we all have on
the golf course.</p><p>One
other round of golf that stands out in all those years in Canada is a round we
played on one of the most beautiful courses of Manitoba. It’s out in the cottage
country and we got picked up by our friend with this boot.</p><p>We were
working on a cottage and took our clubs with us. So that one day we could quit
kind of early and play a round of golf after work.</p><p>So are
buddy picked us up in his boot and we drove over the lake to the golf course.
With lots of drinking and having a great time. Played a round of 18 holes and
went back with the boot. But before we got home some went out for some water skiing.
</p><p>If you
can live like that every day. Who wants to die young?</p><p>That was
my first experience playing golf with friends, and the love for the game was
born.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">a golfers diary</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
